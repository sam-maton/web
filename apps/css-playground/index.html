      <h1>CSS Playground</h1>

      <p>
        The following styles will provide a solid foundation that you can later
        build on. With usability concerns addressed and basic design principles
        in place, you can focus on your content or continue to refine your
        design from there.
      </p>

      <h2>More Logical Box Sizing</h2>

      <p>
        If you've learned CSS from the ground up, you should have a good
        understanding of the box model. But if you're unfamiliar with the
        concept, it can be a confusing one to wrap your head around. Even when
        you know what's going on, working with the browser's default model can
        be awkward, so I recommend you reset box-sizing like this:
      </p>

      <pre>
        <code>
html { box-sizing: border-box; }
*, *:before, *:after { box-sizing: inherit; }
      </code>
    </pre>

      <p>
        The default value for box-sizing is content-box. With that setting, any
        width and height properties you apply to an element will not include
        padding, border, or margin. For example, you might want an element to
        take up half the width of the page:
      </p>

      <pre>
      <code>
#about { width: 50%; padding: 8px; }
      </code>
    </pre>

      <p>
        This will result in a total width of half the container's width plus 16
        pixels (8 pixels on either side). The border-box value for box-sizing
        will ensure that width and height properties include padding and
        borders, making it much easier to create an element that is exactly half
        the width of the page.
      </p>

      <p>
        In short, border-box is a more intuitive way of declaring sizes and will
        probably cause you fewer problems in the long run. By applying it to the
        html element, and then setting all other elements to inherit that value,
        you can easily override it if you need to.
      </p>

      <h2>Optimal Line Length</h2>

      <p>
        There's a reason most books and magazines are in portrait orientation:
        long lines can be difficult to read. When your eye reaches the end of a
        line and moves back to the beginning of the next one, it has to switch
        focus quickly. The further it has to move to do so, the more difficult
        that is.
      </p>

      <p>
        Typography guides generally recommend a line length of between 45 and 75
        characters. You can use the max-width property to ensure your lines
        contain no more than a certain number of characters, using the ch unit:
      </p>

      <pre>
        <code>
html { max-width: 70ch; }
        </code>
      </pre>

      <p>
        The ch unit is relatively unknown, but it's becoming more and more
        important. This unit represents the width of a 0 character in the
        relevant font, so it's a great way to ensure an approximate number of
        characters per line.
      </p>

      <h2>Horizontally Centered Content</h2>

      <p>
        Once you've set a line length, your content will be aligned on the left
        side of the page. Unless your font size is very big, this will often
        look unbalanced, particularly for anyone using a widescreen monitor.
        It's much more comfortable for a reader to look straight ahead than to
        turn their head.
      </p>

      <p>
        The simple fix is to align your content in the center of the browser
        window by giving it equal margins on the left and right:
      </p>

      <pre>
        <code>
html { margin: auto; }
        </code>
      </pre>

      <p>
        This only works when the element—the HTML tag, in this case—has a
        constrained width. If it's a full-width element, there will be no
        margins to balance. The max-width property set earlier means that, with
        any larger window, the content will be centered with equal horizontal
        margins.
      </p>

      <h2>A Comfortable Measure</h2>

      <p>
        In typography, leading refers to the vertical space between lines of
        text. CSS calls this “line height” and specifies a default value of
        “normal” which browsers typically interpret at around 1.2. In other
        words, a line of text will have approximately 10% of its height added as
        space above and below it.
      </p>

      <p>
        The default value is OK but, as with line length, it can cause
        legibility problems. The value you use should ultimately depend on the
        font, line-length, and the average number of words in your paragraphs,
        but a good overall compromise is 1.4, approximately twice as much space
        as the default:
      </p>

      <pre>
        <code>
html { line-height: 1.4; }
        </code>
      </pre>

      <h2>A More Legible Font Size</h2>

      <p>
        The default font-size in most browser environments is 16px, and it has
        been for a long time. As screens get higher resolutions, this produces
        smaller and smaller text which, at some point, gets too uncomfortable
        for most tastes. But the default remains the same.
      </p>

      <p>
        The following declaration uses relative units—em—to bump up the font
        size from what it would otherwise be. In the default case, this takes a
        16px font and increases it to 20px.
      </p>

      <pre>
        <code>
html { font-size: 1.25em; }
        </code>
      </pre>

      <p>
        It's important to note the advantage of this approach over font-size:
        20px. Using em means that, if the user changes their browser settings
        and picks a smaller or larger font than the default, your page will
        scale proportionally.
      </p>

      <h2>Appropriate Header and Body Fonts</h2>

      <p>
        By default, your browser will display text in a serif font. While this
        is fine for body text, it's generally accepted that sans-serif headings
        combine better with a serif body font. Many font families come in pairs
        of serif and sans-serif, specifically for this reason.
      </p>

      <pre>
        <code>
h1, h2, h3, h4, h5, h6 { font-family: sans-serif; }
        </code>
      </pre>

      <p>
        A good template should use the generic font families: serif and
        sans-serif. These are guaranteed to be available and, much like font
        size, the user can still choose their preferred font in a browser like
        Chrome.
      </p>

      <p>
        Using these styles as a baseline, you can add more nuance with a font
        stack, choosing unique fonts that complement your design, while keeping
        the generic families as a fallback.
      </p>

      <h2>Easy Responsive Images</h2>

      <p>
        Images that escape their containers can look ugly at best and break your
        website's layout at worst. If you're not keeping very tight control over
        the images on your site—especially if they can be uploaded by users—this
        is an easy trap to fall into.
      </p>

      <p>
        The easiest safety net is to ensure all images on your page are no wider
        than their container. The max-width property lets you do so:
      </p>

      <pre>
        <code>
img { max-width: 100%; height: auto; }
        </code>
      </pre>

      <p>
        Note that height: auto is required to maintain the original image's
        aspect ratio, if you specify dimensions in your image tags, like this:
      </p>

      <pre>
        <code>
&lt;img width="800" height="400" src="https://placecats.com/bella/800/400" /&gt;
        </code>
      </pre>

      <img width="800" height="400" src="https://placecats.com/bella/800/400" />

      <p>
        With this markup, the max-width property may trim the width, but it
        won't have any effect on the height, so your image will end up stretched
        without height: auto.
      </p>

      <h2>A Suitable Color Contrast</h2>

      <p>
        Good color contrast is key to readability. If your text color is too
        similar to your background color, it can be difficult to read. This goes
        double (or more) for people who have difficulty perceiving certain
        colors.
      </p>

      <p>
        The
        <a href="https://webaim.org/articles/contrast/#sc146" target="_blank"
          >Web Content Accessibility Guidelines</a
        >
        require a contrast ratio of at least 7:1. For reference, the contrast
        ratio of black text (#000000) on a white background (#ffffff) is 21:1,
        which passes the contrast test with flying … colors. However, such a
        stark contrast has a downside: it can put strain on the eyes, caused by
        the need to adjust between such different brightnesses.
      </p>

      <p>
        A very subtle change can make all the difference; not so much that you'd
        notice, but enough that your eyes will:
      </p>

      <pre>
        <code>
html { color: #333; }
        </code>
      </pre>

      <p>
        This very dark gray has a contrast ratio of 12.63:1 on a pure-white
        background, almost half that of pure black, but still easily surpassing
        the 7:1 requirement.
      </p>

      <h2>Removing Link Underlines</h2>

      <p>
        Ever since HTML arrived in the early 1990s, a truism has persisted:
        links are blue and underlined. This is the default and, for the most
        part, it has worked well as a usability feature, informing the reader
        exactly which parts of a document they can click on.
      </p>

      <p>
        However, link underlining can clash with your design and, depending on
        the length of your links, can look ugly and can even harm the
        readability of your text. When CSS became popular, another truism took
        hold: designers turn off link underlining.
      </p>

      <p>
        Whether you decide to do this or not is up to you, but a common
        technique is to hide the underline by default, and show it when the
        reader moves their pointer over the link:
      </p>

      <pre>
        <code>
a:link { text-decoration: none; }
a:hover { text-decoration: underline; }
        </code>
      </pre>

      <p>
        Links will still appear in blue, so they should remain recognizable. If
        you navigate them using the keyboard, they won't be underlined, but the
        browser's default outline style will apply, ensuring you can still
        identify them.
      </p>
    </main>
  </body>
</html>
